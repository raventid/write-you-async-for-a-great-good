# write-you-async-for-a-great-good
Source code for my Lox based async/await tutorial. Initially created as a tutorial for Ruby, I decided to move it to a simpler, artificial educational langauge.

## What happened here?
I've been thinking about writing a small article about my experience of using Ruby's EventMachine and building infrastructe around it for a real application in commercial use, but latter I've decided to transform into something like a real book. So it will take a lot more time to do this, if I will ever complete this endevour :) 

### Plot:

- Chapter 1: Problem we are trying to solve. Introducing client/server, socket concept and plot of our story.
- Chapter 2: Introduction to select, io_uring, kqueue.
- Chapter 3: Building blocks of async: Byte Buffers, Selectors, Event Emmiters
- Chapter 4: Let's build it. Our first async application in plain Lox.
- Chapter 5: Prior art. Callbacks and it's problems.
- Chapter 6: Evolution. Fibers.
- Chapter 7: Modern age Async and Await
- Chapter 8: Let's build it 2. Using fibers as our core abstraction.
- Chapter 9: Let's implement asynchronous TCP.
- Chapter 10: Let's implement asynchronous HTTP 1.1. And why HTTP 2 is beyond our reach.
- Chapter 11: Wrapping up. Async/await, CSP, Actors and other high level models.
- Chapter 12: Async in C, Java, Rust, and Javascript. Further studying.

Plot is in flux, so it might change! :)
