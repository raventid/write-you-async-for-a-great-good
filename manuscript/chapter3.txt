# Coroutine nature

So far we've been talking about this Fiber thing without actually understanding its nature. I think it's time to reveal this fact, that Fiber is an ancient and beautiful concept found
in many programming languages. The idea of coroutine was born many years ago. (link to origin?) We are building a quite low-level library, so I believe we can spend a little time learning about
inner working of Fiber.
