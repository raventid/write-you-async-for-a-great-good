# Eventmachine redux.


A great gift of early 2008 was release of a new Ruby version. In Ruby 1.9 new class Fiber was implemented.

It's interesting to take a look at a brief history of this event.

--- brief history ---

Before reader is falling asleep let's take a Fiber and write some code.

```
fibby = Fiber.new do |value|
  puts value
end
```

Fibby painfully reminds us a function and as you'll in a moment it acts like one!

```
pry> fibby.resume(10)
=> 10
pry>
```

To call fibby we use special method `resume`.



--- numbers generator example ---


--- eventmachine and flat asynchrony example ---


--- fiber as a state machine --- (tough stuff)

--- fiber state machine nature (why it's so suited to async stuff, algebraic effects)
